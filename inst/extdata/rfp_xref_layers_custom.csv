bcfishobs.fiss_fish_obsrvtn_events_vw,https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishobs,whse_fish.fiss_fish_obsrvtn_pnt_sp points referenced to their position on the FWA stream network
bcfishpass.crossings_vw,https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/,Aggregated stream crossing locations. Features are aggregated from 1.PSCIS stream crossings (where possible to match to an FWA stream) 2. CABD dams (where possible to match to an FWA stream) 3. modelled road/rail/trail stream crossings  4. misc anthropogenic barriers from expert/local input

Contains polygons delimiting the watershed group boundary which is a collection of drainage area basins. In-land groups will contain a single polygon, coastal groups may contain multiple polygons (one for each island) i.e., this is a multipart polygon feature. Spatial geometry: multipart polygon"
